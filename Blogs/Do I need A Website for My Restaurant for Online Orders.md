<p>Having an online ordering website for your restaurant is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. Customers demand convenience and speed, and restaurants that embrace this trend are better positioned to enhance customer satisfaction, boost revenue, and expand their reach.</p>
<p>With platforms like <strong>Just Eat Ireland</strong>, <strong>What’s for Dinner</strong>, <strong>Uber Eats</strong>, and <strong>DoorDash</strong> setting the benchmark for online ordering, the restaurant industry is undergoing a significant transformation. But how can you tell if your restaurant is ready to make this leap? And what advantages can a custom-built online ordering system offer? Let’s explore these questions and discover how <a href="https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/en/services/web-development"><strong>Dev Centre House</strong> <strong>Ireland</strong></a> can help you create a seamless platform for online orders.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong>The Global Phenomenon of Food Apps</strong></h3>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img alt="Food Delivery Website and App" class="wp-image-409" decoding="async" height="576" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thpyykbl0-0-1024x576.jpg" srcset="https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thpyykbl0-0-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thpyykbl0-0-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thpyykbl0-0-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thpyykbl0-0-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/thpyykbl0-0.jpg 1600w" width="1024"/></figure>
<p>Food delivery apps have transformed the dining experience. Platforms such as <strong><a href="https://www.just-eat.ie/takeaway/dublin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Just Eat Ireland</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://whatsfordinner.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">What’s for Dinner</a></strong> dominate the Irish market, offering a seamless way for customers to explore menus and place orders. Across the Atlantic, giants like <strong><a href="https://www.ubereats.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Uber Eats</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.doordash.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DoorDash</a></strong> lead the American market.</p>
<p>However, the rise of these platforms comes with challenges. Restaurants often pay significant commissions, cutting into their gross revenue. This is where having your own online ordering website becomes a game-changer. By working with a trusted partner like <strong>Dev Centre House</strong> <strong>Ireland</strong>, you can create a customised website tailored to your restaurant’s needs, helping you retain more revenue and better serve your customers.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size"><strong>Minimum Size of a Restaurant for Online Ordering</strong></h3>
<p>You don’t need a large establishment to benefit from an online ordering system. Even small to mid-sized restaurants with a seating capacity of 20-30 can see remarkable advantages. If your restaurant serves at least 50 orders per day, introducing an online ordering website can enhance operational efficiency and customer reach.</p>
<p><strong>Dev Centre House</strong> <strong>Ireland</strong> specialises in creating scalable and cost-effective solutions for restaurants of all sizes. Whether you’re a local café or a growing chain, their expertise ensures a smooth transition to digital ordering.</p>

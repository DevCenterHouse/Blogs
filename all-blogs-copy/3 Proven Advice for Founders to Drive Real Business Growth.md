</div></figure>
<p>In a business landscape where noise often outweighs value, knowing what truly drives <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revenue</a> is what separates growing <a href="https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/en/startup-program">startups</a> from those that plateau. In the video, Twana and Babar both seasoned founders unpack three grounded, experience-based sales tips that consistently create results. Their insights aren’t theoretical. They’re shaped by years of selling, building, and growing companies from the ground up.</p>
<p>For any founder, CTO, or early-stage team, these takeaways offer a practical framework for creating meaningful sales momentum and sustainable business growth.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Advice 1: Stop Selling and Start Listening</h2>
<p>In the video, Twana opens by flipping the typical sales narrative: instead of pitching, listen. A founder’s natural instinct is to talk about what they’ve built but real sales growth begins when you understand what your potential customer actually needs.</p>
<p>This means approaching every conversation with curiosity, not assumption. Listening reveals gaps, pain points, and goals. It positions you as a problem-solver, not a product pusher.</p>
<p>Founders who adopt this approach build trust faster. Prospects feel seen and heard, and deals move forward because solutions are tailored not generic.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Advice 2: Focus on Outcomes, Not Features</h2>
<p>Babar expands on a major mindset shift: features don’t sell outcomes do. Most sales conversations fail because founders stay stuck in technical details or service descriptions. But customers want to know what changes for them. Will this save time? Increase revenue? Reduce stress?</p>
<p>A founder who leads with outcomes connects emotionally and strategically. It reframes the conversation from what the product does, to what the client gets.</p>
<p>For CTOs, this means aligning your tech narrative to business value. What impact will the solution have? What metrics will it move? The clearer the outcome, the more compelling the sale.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Advice 3: Consistency Beats Talent</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful truth from the video: growth isn’t about flashy pitches it’s about consistent execution. Founders often chase the perfect call or viral post, but in reality, it’s the steady rhythm of follow-ups, emails, and conversations that drives pipeline.</p>
<p>Sales isn’t one moment. It’s a process. And the founders who show up daily, refine their message, and stay close to their leads are the ones who win.</p>
<p>Babar shares how discipline not charisma is what converts prospects into partners. That means blocking time for outreach, tracking progress, and learning from every “no.”</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Mindset Shift That Powers Sales Growth</h2>
<p>What ties these tips together is mindset. A founder with a builder’s mindset approaches sales not as a separate function, but as part of the product. Selling becomes a tool for feedback, validation, and iteration.</p>
<p>In the conversation, Twana and Babar highlight how early-stage teams can transform sales from a stress point into a growth engine. The key is being intentional, human, and resilient.</p>
<p>Founders who embrace this mindset don’t just grow revenue they build credibility, traction, and a loyal client base.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why This Advice Works for Founders and CTOs Alike</h2>
<p>These insights aren’t just for the sales team. CTOs and technical co-founders often overlook their role in shaping the sales narrative. But in founder-led businesses, technical clarity becomes a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>By grounding technical capabilities in business outcomes, CTOs can help simplify the offer, align with buyer priorities, and increase close rates.</p>
<p>Founders who work closely with their tech leads on messaging see faster iteration, stronger demos, and more confident conversations.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts: Applying the Sales Tips Today</h2>
<p>The video isn’t theory it’s a masterclass in founder-led sales. To recap:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Listen before pitching</li>
<li>Sell outcomes, not features</li>
<li>Prioritise consistency over perfection</li>
</ul>
<p>These sales tips are simple but not easy. They require discipline, empathy, and real-time adjustment. But for founders ready to scale with intention, they’re foundational.</p>
<p>If you’re a founder, CTO, or early-stage team member looking to improve your sales game, this is the mindset and method that works proven by founders who’ve done it themselves.</p>

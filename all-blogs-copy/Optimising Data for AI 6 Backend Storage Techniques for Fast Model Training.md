<div class="entry-content" itemprop="text">
<p>In the age of <a href="https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/en/services/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, speed is everything. From training models to deploying them in production, efficiency can make or break your competitive edge. And at the heart of it all? <strong>Data.</strong> More specifically, how that data is stored, retrieved, and processed.</p>
<p>In this post, we explore six powerful <strong>backend storage techniques</strong> that are essential for <strong>fast model training</strong> and overall <strong>data optimisation</strong>. If you’re building AI systems that need to perform at scale, these strategies are game-changers.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Use Columnar Storage for Analytical Speed</h2>
<p>When dealing with large-scale data analytics, <strong>columnar storage</strong> formats such as <strong>Parquet</strong> or <strong>ORC</strong> shine. Unlike row-based formats, columnar storage allows your AI models to access only the fields they need—minimising I/O operations and speeding up training.</p>
<p><br/>It’s especially useful in scenarios where feature selection is key. Instead of loading entire records, your system can retrieve just the necessary columns, improving memory usage and reducing load times.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Columnar formats pair particularly well with data lake architectures and distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Implement Data Lake Architectures</h2>
<p>Traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">databases</a> often fall short when working with the variety, volume, and velocity of data that modern AI requires. Enter <strong>data lakes</strong>—scalable repositories that can store both structured and unstructured data in their native formats.</p>
<p><br/>By combining <strong>object storage</strong> solutions like <strong><a href="https://www.devcentrehouse.eu/en/technologies/cloud/aws">Amazon S3</a></strong>, <strong>Azure Data Lake</strong>, or <strong>Google Cloud Storage</strong> with open formats such as Avro, Parquet, or Delta Lake, data lakes support high-speed access and cost-effective storage. This flexible model accommodates raw datasets, training-ready files, and even inference outputs—all in one place.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Data lakes also allow seamless integration with modern AI tools and frameworks, reducing data prep friction.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Use SSDs and NVMe for High-Throughput Access</h2>
<p>Storage hardware plays a significant role in <strong>fast model training</strong>. <strong>Solid-State Drives (SSDs)</strong> and more advanced <strong>NVMe</strong> storage offer extremely fast read/write speeds compared to traditional spinning disks.<br/>For deep learning workloads—where large datasets are read in parallel—high-throughput storage is vital. </p>
<p>Coupling fast storage with techniques like <strong>data sharding</strong> ensures that GPUs or TPUs are never idle waiting for data.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>NVMe-based storage is especially critical in on-premise setups where latency is a bottleneck.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Cache Preprocessed Data</h2>
<p>Another practical technique is to cache <strong>preprocessed or intermediate datasets</strong>. AI pipelines often spend significant time transforming raw data into a format suitable for training. By caching this intermediate state—either on disk or in-memory—you can bypass repeated transformations for subsequent training runs.</p>
<p><br/>Solutions like <strong>Redis</strong>, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ignite" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Apache Ignite</a></strong>, or even in-memory dataframes in Spark can serve as effective caching layers.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This approach is a massive time-saver during model experimentation, hyperparameter tuning, or when running A/B tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Optimise Data Formats for Model Consumption</h2>
<p>Different models consume data differently. For instance, image classification models benefit from pre-converted image formats (e.g., TFRecord for TensorFlow, LMDB for PyTorch), while tabular models might prefer Arrow or Parquet.</p>
<p><br/>Choosing the right <strong>data format</strong> for your training framework significantly improves throughput. It’s not just about compression—it’s about how quickly data can be decoded, batched, and fed into your model.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Many AI frameworks now support data loaders that are optimised for specific formats—make use of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Distribute Storage Across Nodes for Parallelism</h2>
<p>For massive datasets, single-node storage quickly becomes a bottleneck. Distributed file systems like <strong>HDFS</strong>, <strong>Ceph</strong>, or <strong>Alluxio</strong> break the data into blocks across multiple nodes, enabling <strong>parallel data access</strong> during training.</p>
<p><br/>This is especially powerful when combined with distributed training frameworks like <strong>Horovod</strong> or <strong>PyTorch DDP</strong>, which train models across multiple GPUs or machines.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>With the right setup, this architecture enables you to scale training linearly with your infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wrapping-Up</h2>
<p>Speed and scale are non-negotiable in AI. And while much of the focus is often on the models themselves, the <strong>backend storage techniques</strong> you adopt can dramatically influence training speed, reliability, and scalability.</p>
<p><br/>By combining smart hardware choices, distributed systems, and the right data formats, you can eliminate common bottlenecks and set your AI systems up for long-term success.</p>

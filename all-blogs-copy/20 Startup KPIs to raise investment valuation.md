<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</h2>
<p>CAC indicates how much it costs to acquire a new customer. Lower CACs are generally more attractive to investors.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Lifetime Value (LTV) of Customers</h2>
<p>LTV is the total revenue a business expects from a customer over the customer’s lifetime. A high LTV signifies a sustainable business model.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Customer Lifetime Value to CAC Ratio</h2>
<p>The LTV/CAC ratio compares the lifetime value of a customer to the cost of acquiring that customer. A ratio of 3:1 or higher is generally desirable.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Gross Margin</h2>
<p>Gross margin shows the difference between revenue and the cost of goods sold, indicating profitability.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Operating Margin</h2>
<p>Operating margin is the operating income divided by net sales, providing insight into operating efficiency.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. Burn Rate</h2>
<p>The burn rate measures the rate at which a startup spends its cash. A lower burn rate is often more favorable to investors.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. Churn Rate</h2>
<p>Churn rate is the percentage of customers who stop using a product or service. Low churn rates indicate customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9. Conversion Rate</h2>
<p>Conversion rate is the percentage of users who perform a desired action, such as making a purchase. High conversion rates can signal a strong value proposition.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10. Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU)</h2>
<p>DAU/MAU shows the number of users actively engaging with the product daily or monthly. High DAU/MAU signifies a strong user base.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11. Net Promoter Score (NPS)</h2>
<p>NPS measures customer loyalty and advocacy. A high NPS means customers are likely to recommend the product.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">12. Average Revenue per Paying User (ARPU)</h2>
<p>ARPU indicates the revenue generated per paying user. It helps in understanding the monetization efficiency.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">13. Customer Retention Rate</h2>
<p>Customer retention rate is the percentage of customers who continue to use the product over a given period. High retention rates suggest customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">14. Cost per Lead</h2>
<p>Cost per lead measures the cost associated with acquiring a new lead. Lower cost per lead signifies efficient marketing strategies.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">15. Return on Advertising Spend (ROAS)</h2>
<p>ROAS measures the profit generated for each dollar spent on advertising. High ROAS indicates effective ad spending.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">16. Time to Market</h2>
<p>Time to market is the time it takes to develop and release a new product. Shorter times to market can signal agility and innovation.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">17. Total Addressable Market (TAM)</h2>
<p>TAM estimates the total revenue potential for the product if it achieves 100% market penetration. A large TAM can be very attractive to investors.</p>

<p>Market penetration rate measures the percentage of the target market that has been captured by the startup. High penetration rates signify market share dominance.</p>

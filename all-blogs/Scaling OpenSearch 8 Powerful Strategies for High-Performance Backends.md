<p>When it comes to powering high-performance search solutions, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch_(software)" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">OpenSearch</a></strong> is a popular choice for many organisations. However, ensuring optimal performance at scale is essential for delivering fast and reliable results. Whether you’re dealing with large datasets or high query volumes, <strong>scaling OpenSearch</strong> effectively is key to maintaining a responsive and robust backend.</p>
<p><br/>In this article, we explore <strong>8 powerful strategies</strong> that can help you scale OpenSearch to meet the demands of high-performance backends.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Cluster Sizing and Sharding for Optimal Distribution</strong></h2>
<p>One of the first steps in scaling OpenSearch is properly sizing your <strong>cluster</strong>. The size of your OpenSearch cluster should match the volume of data and the query load you expect. The distribution of data is handled through <strong>shards</strong>, which break your data into smaller pieces, allowing them to be distributed across multiple nodes in the cluster.</p>
<p><br/>To ensure high availability and performance, it’s essential to have an adequate number of <strong>primary</strong> and <strong>replica</strong> shards. The <strong>primary shards</strong> store the original data, while <strong>replica shards</strong> provide redundancy and help balance the query load.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> For high traffic applications, aim for a minimum of three nodes to ensure fault tolerance and balanced distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. <strong>Use Node Types to Optimise Resource Allocation</strong></h2>
<p>Different types of nodes serve different purposes in an OpenSearch cluster. For example, you can designate certain nodes as <strong>data nodes</strong>, which are responsible for storing and processing data, while others can be designated as <strong>master nodes</strong> or <strong>client nodes</strong>.</p>
<p><br/>By distributing the roles across multiple nodes, you can ensure that each node is optimised for specific tasks, such as query processing, indexing, or cluster management. This segmentation helps prevent any one node from becoming overwhelmed, improving the overall performance and scalability of the system.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Designate dedicated <strong>master nodes</strong> to handle cluster management tasks, and separate <strong>data nodes</strong> for indexing and querying large datasets.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. <strong>Horizontal Scaling for Increased Throughput</strong></h2>
<p>Horizontal scaling involves adding more nodes to your OpenSearch cluster to distribute the load across more machines. By expanding the number of nodes, you can <strong>increase throughput</strong> and ensure that your system can handle higher volumes of search queries and indexing operations.</p>
<p>Adding more nodes increases the available resources (CPU, RAM, storage), which enhances the overall performance and reliability of your OpenSearch backend. As a result, you can support a growing number of users without sacrificing speed or accuracy.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Monitor the health of your cluster and add new nodes when you notice resource saturation, such as high CPU or memory usage.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. <strong>Efficient Index Management for Faster Search Performance</strong></h2>
<p>As your data grows, the number of indices in your OpenSearch cluster may also increase. Efficient <strong>index management</strong> is crucial to maintaining optimal search performance.</p>
<p><br/>To improve performance, consider implementing the following strategies:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Index Lifecycle Management (ILM):</strong> Automate the management of indices based on their age or size, such as archiving old data and deleting unnecessary indices.</li>
<li><strong>Index Templates:</strong> Use templates to define index settings and mappings for consistency across similar types of data.</li>
<li><strong>Rolling Indices:</strong> Instead of adding more data to existing indices, create new indices periodically to distribute the load.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Use ILM to automatically roll over indices when they exceed a certain size, keeping your system clean and efficient.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. <strong>Caching for Faster Query Responses</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Caching</strong> is a powerful strategy for improving the speed of repeated search queries. By storing previously executed queries and their results in mem</p>
<p>ory, OpenSearch can return results almost instantaneously without needing to reprocess the query.<br/>You can use <strong>query result caching</strong> and <strong>filter caching</strong> to store the results of common queries and filters, reducing the strain on your system. Additionally, setting up <strong>HTTP caching</strong> for your OpenSearch endpoints can also improve response times for repeated requests.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Keep in mind that caching is most effective for queries that are frequently repeated and do not change frequently.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. <strong>Optimise Search Queries for Efficiency</strong></h2>
<p>Optimising search queries is another essential part of scaling OpenSearch. Complex queries with multiple filters, aggregations, or sorting operations can slow down performance. Here are a few tips to ensure your queries are efficient:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--xx-small);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--xx-small)"><strong>Avoid wildcard queries:</strong> Wildcard queries can be slow because they require OpenSearch to scan many documents. Use <strong>prefix queries</strong> or <strong>edge n-grams</strong> when possible.</li>
<li style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--xx-small);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--xx-small)"><strong>Use filters instead of queries:</strong> Filters are faster than queries because they do not score documents.</li>
<li style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--xx-small);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--xx-small)"><strong>Limit the number of returned results:</strong> Returning a large number of results can be resource-intensive. Consider using pagination or limiting the number of results returned.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> For a high-traffic search engine, limit the results to a smaller subset (e.g., 10 to 20 results per query) to improve response times.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7. <strong>Monitor and Automate Cluster Health Checks</strong></h2>
<p>Regular monitoring of your OpenSearch cluster is essential for ensuring that it’s performing optimally. Automated health checks can help identify issues such as node failures, slow queries, or resource bottlenecks before they impact performance.</p>
<p><br/>Use tools like <strong>OpenSearch Dashboards</strong> or <strong>Elasticsearch’s monitoring features</strong> to visualise key metrics such as CPU usage, disk I/O, and query response times. Setting up <strong>alerting systems</strong> based on certain thresholds (e.g., high memory usage or slow queries) can help you take proactive actions to maintain optimal performance.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Automate the scaling process by integrating with orchestration tools like Kubernetes to automatically add or remove nodes based on the cluster’s performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8. <strong>Leverage Cross-Cluster Search for Global Scalability</strong></h2>
<p>If you have multiple data centres or geographically dispersed systems, <strong>cross-cluster search</strong> can help scale your OpenSearch deployment across multiple clusters. This allows you to query data from multiple OpenSearch clusters in different regions or locations, without having to move the data itself.</p>
<p><br/>By using cross-cluster search, you can distribute your search load across multiple clusters, improving search response times and enabling global scalability. This is particularly useful for organisations with large-scale, geographically distributed datasets.</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>Example:</strong> A global e-commerce platform can query multiple clusters in different regions to provide localised search results without compromising speed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts</h2>

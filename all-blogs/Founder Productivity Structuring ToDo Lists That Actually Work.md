<p>For founders and CTOs, managing time isn’t just about crossing tasks off a list it’s about building momentum across multiple areas of the business. With daily context switching between strategy, product, team, and operations, the structure of a ToDo list becomes less about organisation and more about survival. The video “15 Years, 1 System” outlines a proven method that has helped one founder thrive for over a decade. This blog unpacks the same structure and shows how it can be applied by other CEOs and CTOs to stay focused, prioritised, and consistently productive.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Founders Need a Unique Structure for ToDo Lists</h2>
<p>Unlike traditional roles, founders and CTOs deal with high cognitive load. Tasks range from deep work like writing code or defining product specs, to shallow tasks like replying to quick DMs. The reason most ToDo lists fail? They treat all tasks equally.</p>
<p>The system shared in the video prioritises what matters most and avoids burnout. It’s built not just for ticking boxes, but for building clarity and sustainable momentum.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Core Framework Behind the 15-Year System</h2>
<p>The video walks through a foundational principle: the daily list is not a backlog it’s a front line. Everything that lands on it must be intentional. The structure involves:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One master list, used as a brain dump</li>
<li>A separate Today List, focused only on high-leverage items</li>
<li>A weekly planning cadence that aligns execution with business goals</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework keeps execution aligned with priorities, not just urgency. For CTOs and CEOs juggling engineering and vision, this clarity saves hours every week.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Structuring the Master List for Visibility and Control</h2>
<p>The Master List is a structured space where everything lands ideas, bugs, feature requests, strategy thoughts, and personal admin. The key is not to filter prematurely. Instead, this list becomes a dynamic inventory of commitments and possibilities.</p>
<p>For example, during founder 1:1s or product ideation, items are captured quickly here. Once per week, this list is reviewed and triaged into categories like: urgent, delegate, revisit later, or never.</p>
<p>This gives founders full visibility into everything in motion, without getting lost in the chaos.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Daily List: Where Focus Lives</h2>
<p>This is where execution happens. The video emphasises that this list should never have more than 3 to 5 items. Why? Because overloading a day leads to cognitive fatigue and discouragement.</p>
<p>Items on the Daily List must be high-leverage things that move key objectives forward. For a CTO, this might mean approving architecture plans, reviewing strategic hires, or prepping for a board update. Each task is chosen intentionally, based on energy levels, available time, and strategic alignment.</p>
<p>This structured discipline turns the ToDo list from a guilt trip into a success ritual.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Weekly Reviews: The Strategic Layer Most Founders Skip</h2>
<p>The 15-Year System revolves around one ritual: the Weekly Review. It’s where the structure meets strategy. Every week, the founder takes time to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Review what was completed</li>
<li>Reassess pending items</li>
<li>Reset the focus for the coming week</li>
</ul>
<p>This cycle isn’t just admin it’s reflection, adjustment, and momentum recalibration. It allows founders to shift between high-urgency sprints and long-term moves, without losing the thread.</p>
<p>For CTOs, this review also connects team-level initiatives to personal responsibilities, ensuring alignment across engineering, product, and growth.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How This System Empowers Better Leadership</h2>
<p>In the video, the founder shares how structuring the ToDo list helped scale the business, not just personal output. It became a leadership tool a way to model prioritisation, pace, and clarity for the entire team.</p>
<p>By managing visibility and capacity with intention, it’s easier to avoid reactive leadership. Teams see a consistent decision-making style. They understand what matters. And most importantly, founders stay in control of their energy.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Final Thoughts: Building a Founder’s Edge Through Structure</h2>
<p>15 years of results don’t lie. The system shown in the video isn’t about being productive for the sake of productivity it’s about staying focused on what matters as a founder or CTO. Structuring a ToDo list with this level of discipline and flexibility turns chaos into clarity.</p>
<p>To summarise:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use a master list to capture everything</li>
<li>Structure a daily list with only high-leverage tasks</li>
<li>Build a weekly review to stay aligned</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a system designed not for perfection, but for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability_organization" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">sustainability</a>. For any founder, CTO, or CEO trying to lead, build, and grow without burning out this method is worth adopting.</p>

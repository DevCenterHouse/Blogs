For tech founders, the opportunities to network with investors, mentors, and fellow entrepreneurs are unmatched.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Why Ireland Attracts Global Startups</h3>
<p>One of the reasons Ireland is a goldmine for tech founders is its strategic location. As an English speaking country in the EU, it offers easy access to both European and global markets.

<p>For founders seeking to build international teams, Ireland’s multicultural workforce is a significant advantage. Over the years, the author has had the privilege of working with talented engineers and innovators from across the world, creating diverse teams that drive creativity and growth.</p>

The author has personally benefited from these initiatives when scaling teams and raising funding.</p>
<p>Ireland’s close-knit tech community also ensures that valuable advice, introductions, and collaborations are always within reach. For founders, this level of support can make the difference between struggling alone and accelerating the path to success.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Lessons from 20+ Years Living and Building in Ireland</h3>
